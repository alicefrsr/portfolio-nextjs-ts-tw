      <p className='mb-3'>
        In a previous life I was a <strong>film editor</strong> based in London
        for 20 years, working on TV & feature documentaries, music promos,
        corporate videos, commercials, 2D/3D animation and VFX editing.

        I left after Brexit in pursuit of new horizons and sailing adventures,
        which led me to the CÃ´te d&#39;Azur in France, the Costa Brava and
        Mallorca in Spain, juggling working as a
        <strong> deck/stew, crew cook </strong> or
        <strong> junior engineer </strong>
        on private superyachts during the summer in the Mediterranean
        (2017-2020), with short editing contracts with my regular clients back
        in London during the winter.

        As the world shut down during the pandemic in 2020, it was a chance to
        explore what <strong>programming</strong> was all about. Two months of
        Python during lockdown got me hooked. Since 2022 I've been focusing on
        building things for the web and adding to my skillset full-time every
        day.
